# Analysis of Models

# Logistic Regression

Before tunning my hyperparameter, my logistic regression model had an accuracy of about 84%. Which is a pretty decent starting accuracy, but I was able to improve it to about 88% 
once I tunned my hyperparameter with Grid Search.

# Deep Learning

I built just a normal neural network to see if I can get a better accuracy than the logistic regression. Just as I had expected I did get a better accuracy of about 89%, but if I
add another layer or two then my accuracy should be over 90%.

# Conclusion

Both models are good for predicting possible exoplanets, but my neural network is the one I would use to predict new exoplanets. Especially after adding some more layers to the 
neural network.
