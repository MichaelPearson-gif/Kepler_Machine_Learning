# Kepler_Machine_Learning

By taking nine years worth of data from the Kepler Space Telescope, I will be preproccessing it and using the data to create a machine learning algorithim to try and find hidden exoplanets.

# Getting Started

Download or clone the repo, then make sure you have Python3 or the latest version of Python downloaded. If you do not have Sci-Kit installed, make sure you do a pip-install sklearn. Once all of that is done, open the project in Jupyter Notebooks and you can start playing with the code to see if you can get a better score than what I got.

# Built With:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [SciKit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Grid Search](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html)
